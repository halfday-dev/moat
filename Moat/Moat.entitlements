    NOTE: The host app does NOT enable com.apple.security.app-sandbox here.
    App Sandbox is intentionally omitted because the host app needs to:
    1. Install/manage system extensions (requires elevated privileges)
    2. Read the shared flow log file written by the filter extension
    If sandboxing is needed later, use an app group container for IPC.
